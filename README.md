# Higher Order Function Deep Dive

## Description

The higher order function deep dive will look into use cases of FoldLeft/FoldRight functions, Map function, MapFirst function, flatMap, and others. We will use these functions in different tree data structures, working our way from simple use cases to more complex cases such as a tree whose nodes are lists. This material can be used as a study guide to master higher-order functions in Scala, as well as to obtain a deep understanding of representing data structures through abstract syntax. An example of what will be done is: summing the nodes of a tree using FoldLeft/FoldRight, progressing to summing the nodes of a tree whose nodes are a list of integers, requiring the addition of other higher-order functions such as Map. Other use cases and data structures will be added as the project progresses, but all higher-order functions mentioned will be used. The material will be presented as a recorded slide-show with a voice over and should be used by students reviewing for the final exam.
